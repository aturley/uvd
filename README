For the record, I wrote this in a few hours (over the course of about
a week) on a dare. I won a bottle of Johnny Walker Blue. Well, the
bottle was also a birthday present, but I think I still managed to
impress with the game.

This code is horrible. At some point I may try to clean it up. But
maybe not. Let this be a warning.

The game is simple. It is a Pong clone. One player is the unicorn, the
other player is the dolphin. The only really exciting parts are that
it was designed to be controlled using DDR pads, and you can control
how hard you hit the ball by jumping on the "left" and "right" buttons
on the pad. So imagine a bunch of drunks on my porch stomping
furiously on some poor dance pads and you'll understand why I have a
warm spot in my heart for this project.
