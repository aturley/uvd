Unicorn vs. Dolphin

--

Genesis
* Wanted to throw a party
* Picked funny pictures, sent out the invitations
* We have a theme, now what do we do?
* Let's have a video game!

--

The Party Game
Multi-player combat, not co-op
Fast paced
Simply, easy to learn (easy to play drunk)
Involving input (think Wii, Rock Band, Guitar Hero, etc)
Sounds!

--

Considerations
Two weeks to write a game
Game will be fairly computationally simple
Not a long term project
Probably never look at the code again
No time for beta period
It either works, or it doesn't work
Learn as you go, prototype becomes product
I haven't written a game in years
I haven't written any sort of graphical application in a while
I know Python
I have dance pads

Scotch
* I tried Johnny Walker Blue once, enjoyed it
* A bottle was offered if I finished the game in time for the party

--

Why Pygame
* I know Python
  * Rapid development
  * Good mix of programming styles (OO, functional, etc)
* Used Pygame once, years ago, to make a box move on the screen
* Support for graphics, sound, game controllers
* More a collection of classes than a complicated framework
* Lots of tutorials
